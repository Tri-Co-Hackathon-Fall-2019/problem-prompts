[Philadelphia Lawyers for Social Equity (PLSE)](http://plsephilly.org/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit legal aid organization. PLSE’s mission is to work toward just outcomes for low-income individuals who have had contact with the Pennsylvania criminal justice system. Through individual representation, strategic litigation, community education, research, and legislative advocacy, PLSE advocates for a more equitable social environment for those with criminal records, including expanding access to employment and social services.

For this year’s Trico Hackathon, we hope to offer participants three main categories of prompts for their projects as they relate to Philadelphia-area community organizations--issues, needs, and specific project ideas. This will be a great opportunity for students to develop projects focused on positive impact informed by direct input from organizations who do community-engaged work.

## ISSUES

What issues are most important to the communities you reach? What social and political issues are most important to your organization?

- Combating misinformation surrounding criminal records
- Demystifying legal knowledge and ensure that people have easy-to-understand information on legal issues that impact their lives
- Allowing impacted communities to be fully informed and empowered to make decisions on their own

## NEEDS

What specific needs do members of your community express most frequently? What are the most timely or pressing needs you see?

- Clearing criminal records to get stable, reliable employment
- Clients often have records in other states or counties outside of Philadelphia, so easy access to other resources is a timely need

## IDEAS

What specific projects would your organization undertake if you had the resources or expertise? What apps or technical tools would help serve your community?

- Creating database of expungement and pardon law nationally, expanding and including employment and voting rights for criminal records
- Creating an easy-to-use map where people can access the above information and be connected to the appropriate resources
- New logo
- Graphics/visuals explaining the expungement and pardon processes in an accessible way to our target audience
