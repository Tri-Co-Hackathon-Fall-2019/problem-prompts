# Puentes De Salud

![Puentes de Salud](http://www.puentesdesalud.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PuentesDeSalud-1.png)

The mission of [Puentes de Salud](http://www.puentesdesalud.org/) is two-fold: First, to partner with Philadelphia’s rapidly growing Latinx immigrant community to build long-term prosperity by addressing immediate education, health and social service needs. Second, to create a responsible learning environment for future generations of advocates, educators, and healthcare providers to examine Social Justice and Structural Violence, and to explore their impacts on the Social Determinants of Health within a marginalized community.

For this year’s Trico Hackathon, we hope to offer participants three main categories of prompts for their projects as they relate to Philadelphia-area community organizations--issues, needs, and specific project ideas. This will be a great opportunity for students to develop projects focused on positive impact informed by direct input from organizations who do community-engaged work.

## ISSUES

What issues are most important to the communities you reach? What social and political issues are most important to your organization?

1. Border politics
2. Immigration law 
3. ICE, ICE-police collaboration, sanctuary city in reality 
4. Educational equity, public education, bilingual education 
5. Parent voice and organizing; student voice 
6. Shared leadership structures (organization - families - community) 

## NEEDS

What specific needs do members of your community express most frequently? What are the most timely or pressing needs you see?

1. More information around/grounding with legal realm - especially immigration law and status, family law (divorce, custody, getting passports for this and other countries of home origin)
2. More information surrounding mental and emotional health realm for their children and themselves and families
3. Financial literacy and how to build wealth and practices to teach with kids/at home to work towards greater financial stability - ‘what wealthy families know and teach their kids/families that we don’t’ 

## IDEAS

What specific projects would your organization undertake if you had the resources or expertise? What apps or technical tools would help serve your community?

1. *“After today’s news of the raids in Mississippi I want us to be ready for such a raid in Philly.  Kids and families who suddenly face loss of breadwinners and family will acutely need our support and we must have a simple way to connect with Puentes.   I anticipate that in many cases this will be folks (neighbors/concerned US citizens) simply looking to do the right thing.   A way to centralize resources would be huge.  This could evolve in parallel with our discussion on establishing a food bank.  We need to prepare.” 
    - possible thoughts on also doing some kind of shared work with a food-bank or other relevant organization, a food bank that has staples like rice, beans, vegetables, etc. has been a dream and talk for a long time, both for general food insecurity and more pressing now with detentions and deportations. The first point of a rapid response kind of system or platform is related and also a separate idea, more development needed. 
2. An app/platform in Spanish that helps connect individuals or families with relevant services or goods needed. A lot of this information exists in different forms and spaces but is often hard to bring together - like info re: food pop up farm stands with free groceries are on flyers handed out in one location, info re: another kind of service is elsewhere - kind of like the 2-1-1 that United Way has but a more accessible or mobile app (not sure if this already exists) version of that ?? Also with sensitivity to different literacy levels of adults/older teens and that Spanish is not the first language for everyone, too. 
3. A food pantry at our community wellness center with basics/staples (beans, rice, meat, veggies) to support families who may have a family member detained and/or deported, newly arrived families, or who are otherwise in a difficult situation
4. Programming even more specifically designed for newly arriving students and families from Central America 
5. Some sort of series/talks on asylum and what to do now that you are here? - more support for welcoming ambassadors group that connects with newly arriving families 
6. A way to integrate google voice and whatsapp group message functions - so that we could do something like large group chats/messages with families like whatsapp but with a google voice number (instead of being linked to whatsapp with our personal numbers) - in place of getting new specific work phones for each staff member or program ($)
